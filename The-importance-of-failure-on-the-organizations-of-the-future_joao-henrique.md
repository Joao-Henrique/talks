Description
-----------

“Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,” as Winston Churchill said, yet we tend to look at failure as something to avoid at all costs. For most of us, the fear of failure is preventing us from reaching our full potential and therefore success. In this talk, I will take you on a rollercoaster journey through my career change, failure, success, soft skills, leadership and how the organizations of the future will thrive with more humane developers.

Extra Information
-----------------

In this talk, I will use my career change from the health department to web development as a theme to explain how the fear of failure is preventing us to take action, to take risks, to learn new stuff and therefore achieve more success in our careers. I will relate this to how we acquire soft skills, become leaders and how companies are depending on this to thrive when the algorithms start writing most of our code. This talk is a wake-up call for the regular persons to assume ownership of their lives and start making shit happen.
